Type-II supernovae are the most common class of supernovae; these are the fate of stars with mass > 8 solar masses. The gravitational energy of the star becomes inbalanced as nuclear fusion of Hydrogen in the core ceases. This leads to the collapse of the core to form a neutron star. The evolution of the explosion has been of much interest in the field of astrophysics. Over roughly one second, the matter infalls rapidly against the protoneutron star (PNS) and causes a shockwave that propagates through the material as heavier and heavier elements are fused in an onion-like configuration. The complexities of these explosions require specialty subfields, where different researchers invest their talent to improve these regimes of the simulations. In the work presented, efforts to map thermonuclear abundances post-simulation are discussed. Interpolation using k-nearest neighbor methods were used and approaches to handle numerical issues at the boundaries were considered.
