## Hi, I'm **Carrie Elliott** — a computational physics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ##

My background is multifaceted;  I have experience in - 
- accelerator operations
- nuclear physics
- computational astrophysics

My path in physics has taken a few turns...

... from studying the fundamental physics of quark distributions at Jefferson Lab, to developing machine learning tools for accelerator operations, back into *the frontier of computational astrophysics*, where I first fell in love. 

I'm particularly interested in how **neutrinos** — elusive, nearly massless particles — influence the dynamics and observable signatures of energetic astrophysical environments like **core-collapse supernovae** and **neutron star mergers**.

My current research under [Dr. Sherwood Richers](https://sites.google.com/view/sherwoodrichers/home) focuses on understanding the impact of **neutrino radiation transport methods** on these extreme systems, blending theoretical physics with high-performance computing.

More broadly, I'm driven by questions at the intersection of physics, computation, and maybe a bit of philosophy: 
- How does fundamental particle behavior shape the evolution of the universe, specifically through these cosmic events?  
- What role do neutrinos play in the synthesis of heavy elements?  
- How can modern computational tools push our understanding of the universe forward?

Outside of research, I care deeply about mentorship, equity in science, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
I enjoy contributing to outreach efforts that bring physics and coding into classrooms and community spaces that might otherwise feel excluded from science.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to check out my [CV](/cv/) or [publications](/publications/), and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just talk science.
